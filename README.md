### Image Captioning API

This is an API endpoint for generating captions for images using the Salesforce BLIP model.

### Usage

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/caption` with an image file and an optional `text` parameter for conditional captioning.
2. The API will return the generated caption for the image.

### Key features of the "blip-image-captioning-api" project:

1. FastAPI Integration: The API is built using FastAPI, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs in Python. FastAPI provides automatic API documentation, request validation, and high performance out of the box.
2. BLIP Model: The project utilizes the pre-trained BLIP model from Hugging Face Transformers, which has been trained on a large dataset of image-caption pairs. BLIP achieves impressive results in generating accurate and coherent captions for a wide range of images.
3. Easy Image Upload: The API allows users to upload images via a simple HTTP POST request, making it convenient to integrate image captioning functionality into various applications.
4. Conditional Image Captioning: In addition to generating captions based solely on the image content, the API supports conditional image captioning. Users can provide an optional text input along with the image to guide the caption generation process.
5. Containerization with Docker: The project is containerized using Docker, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment for running the API. Docker simplifies the deployment process and makes it easy to scale the application.
6. Comprehensive Documentation: The repository includes detailed documentation on how to set up, run, and interact with the image captioning API. It provides step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations of the project's architecture and components.
7. Extensibility and Customization: The codebase is modular and well-structured, allowing developers to easily extend and customize the API according to their specific requirements. The project serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced image captioning applications.

Whether you are a developer interested in exploring image captioning techniques, a researcher studying deep learning for computer vision, or someone looking to integrate image captioning functionality into your application, the "blip-image-captioning-api" repository provides a valuable resource and starting point. It demonstrates the power of combining FastAPI and the BLIP model to create a robust and efficient image captioning API.
